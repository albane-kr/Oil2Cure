# OIL2CURE

This is my first "big" project for my first-year of Bachelor in Computer Science (October-December 2022)

Oil2Cure is an app that recommends essential oils to soothe different kind of symptoms.

You may find in this folder:
	
	- a folder "knowledge_base" with all the data for this project
	- a folder for the mockup with all the different graphical design items of the app (made with Figma)
	- a python file with the code of the app

I uploaded the code without really reviewing it so they may be scaling issues depending on your device's screen dimensions.
